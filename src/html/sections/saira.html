      <h3>Origins</h3>
      <p>
        HÃ©ctor Gatti got his inspiration from the square blueprint of Saira, the town where he was born and that gave the typeface its name. This typeface reflects the spirit of the town founders, the 20th century, hardworking and clever blacksmiths that turned into inventors of machinery for working the fields.
      </p>
      <p>
        Saira is a combination of the creative and the industrial, the sensitive and the efficient. It displays great aesthetic sensibility that combines a geometric tendency with open shapes, flat curves and some whimsical details.
