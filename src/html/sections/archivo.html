        Archivo (same as its popular sister Archivo Narrow) was created to meet to a specific need. The spirit and style of Chivo is adapted to specific spacing and kerning for document compatibility with another widely available sans serif font family.

      <p class="u-ff-manuale u-push-btm-none">
        The initial challenge of this project was to harmonize the neo-grotesque style of Chivo with the demands and restrictions of document fidelity. The next level is the integration of the Archivo and Archivo Narrow fonts with Archivo Black in order to make it a technically and stylistically coherent super-family with a set of style varying by width and weight.
