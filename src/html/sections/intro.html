        Welcome to a showcase of the Omnibus-Type <em>Press Series</em>, a new collection of typefaces made specifically for text-intensive formats like books, magazines, and newspapers -- both onscreen and in print. The collection was inspired by historical sources of fine typography, and each font was designed for immersive reading with generous proportions and traditional details.

      <p class="u-push-top-half u-push-btm-none js-widowfix">
        <a class="u-td-underline" href="#faustina">Faustina</a> and <a class="u-td-underline" href="#manuale">Manuale</a> are the stars of the collection. These two serif typefaces have taller x-heights, providing legibility and a harmonious appearance for extended reading. Both are presented in a set of eight styles: Four weights from Regular to Bold plus Italics.

      <p class="u-push-top-half u-push-btm-none js-widowfix">
        <a class="u-td-underline" href="#archivo">Archivo</a> and <a class="u-td-underline" href="#asap-condensed">Asap Condensed</a> are two brand-new releases, presented in four weights from Regular to Bold plus italics. This pair maintain the same features of their sister fonts, Archivo Narrow and Asapâ€”two of the most popular Omnibus-Type projects.

      <p class="u-push-top-half u-push-btm-none js-widowfix">
        <a class="u-td-underline" href="#saira">Saira</a> is the <em>Press Series</em> luminary. A versatile tool for composing elegant and impressive headlines, this sans-serif superfamily features a comprehensive suite of styles: nine weights that scale from Thin to Black across four widths, from Normal to Extra Condensed, totaling 36 styles in all.

        The Omnibus-Type collective was founded upon a shared typographic passion among its members. Our work is conceived at the intersection of different ideas, cultures, and even continents. At Omnibus, typefaces are born and given room to grow and develop as living beings with pulsing thoughts, knowledge, and emotions. 
      </p>
      <p class="u-push-top-half u-push-btm-none js-widowfix">
        Whether these fonts are displayed on screen or printed on paper, created by old-school artists or digital natives, Omnibus combines insights from academic research with common sense from strolling the streets. Some projects are born free, to be used and seen by millions all over the world, while others begin with a client in search of an exclusive brand font or unique letterform identity.
      </p>
      <p class="u-push-top-half u-push-btm-none js-widowfix">
        All of our works are continuously maturing and evolving. Omnibus-Type combines aesthetic sense with technical precision, continually adapting to new uses, new languages, and new technologies.
