        Google Fonts provides an intuitive and robust directory of open source designer web fonts. Google Fonts Early Access is an experimental showcase for fonts that arenâ€™t yet fully supported.

        Japanese typeface design and font development presents many interesting challenges, from the time it takes to design thousands and thousands of available characters, to the technical infrastructure required to serve large font files as web fonts. As standards and technology continue to develop, we invite designers and developers to experiment with the Japanese web fonts now available on Google Fonts Early Access.
