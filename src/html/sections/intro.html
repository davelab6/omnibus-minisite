          A new collection of typefaces that are made specifically for text-intensive typography such as in books, magazines and newspapers in both screen and print media.

          Conceived at the intersection of different ideas, cultures and continents, the members of the Omnibus-Type collective are all connected by the same typographic passion. For these designers, typefaces are born, grow and develop as living beings with pulsing thoughts, knowledge and emotions.

        <p class="u-push-top-half u-push-btm-none js-widowfix">
          Whether they are to be displayed on screen or printed on paper, if they are created by old-school artists or digital natives, the Omnibus-Types works combines insights from academic research with common sense from walking the streets. Some projects are born free, to be used and seen by millions all over the world, while other projects begin when clients approach Omnibus-Type to specifically create their exclusive brand fonts and create unique letterforms of their identity.
        </p>
        <p class="u-push-top-half u-push-btm-none js-widowfix">
          All of them are continuously maturing and evolving. A true combination of aesthetic acumen and technical precision requires continual adaptation to new uses, new languages, and new technologies.
