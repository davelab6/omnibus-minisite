        By the end of 2014, Eduardo and Pablo expanded the sets to over 700 characters to make Manuale suitable for every language written with the Latin alphabet, and designed in two intermediate weights to comply with the different reproduction needs for print and screen display. The result was a complete suite of 8 styles (Regular, Medium, Semibold and Bold, plus Italics).

        Given its high stroke contrast, Manuale could be considered a transitional typeface. Its main features are sharp, upright serifs. Together with its flat curves, Manuale offers compressed words of rectangular appearance, ideal for editorial use. The large x-height with short ascenders and descenders favors small leading, saving vertical space while remaining comfortable to read in extended text settings.

      <p class="u-ff-manuale u-push-btm-none">
        For the purpose of stylistic definition, they hand sketched the initial characters, respecting many characteristics of the original design. Eduardo Tunni and Pablo Cosgaya tried to preserve the sharp and metallic appearance, while adjusting the baseline, proportions, spacing and terminals. Once they had determined the typographic color of each style, the project was expanded into a complete suite of eight styles (Regular, Medium, Bold, and Semibold plus Italics).
      </p>
      <p class="u-ff-manuale u-push-btm-none u-ti-double">
        The designers wanted Manuale’s Italics to be more mechanical and less ornamental than the ones in the original printing. They achieved this effect by redrawing a condensed and inclined version of the Regular style.

      <p class="u-ff-manuale u-push-btm-none">
        The process was divided into three stages. First, they developed exploratory hand-drawn sketches in order to find the distinct features of the original print specimen to include their design. The key decision was whether to do a historical revival (with irregular structures, coarse stroke, uneven baseline, and weight variations) or a contemporary interpretation. After these initial explorations, they decided on the latter approach. After establishing proportions for an editorial typeface, they moved on to the concrete task of digital drawing. As they defined the font’s spacing, they performed frequent tests of typesetting and readability.
      </p>
      <p class="u-ff-manuale u-push-btm-none u-ti-double">
        Their goal was to achieve space efficiency without compromising the body size of the typeface. For this purpose, in addition to its compacted verticals, Manuale displays a considerable compression that is hardly noticeable due to its flat curves.

        One of the main concerns in designing Manuale was to maintain the proportion between uppercase letters and ascenders. The challenge was to produce distinguished and important capital letters, in spite of being of moderate height. Eduardo and Pablo gave priority to the uppercase numbers, making these the default, and provided alternative access to the old-style numerals (also known as lowercase or proportional figures.)

        On account of the attachment they developed toward Manuale, they tested the performance of the typeface in the composition of texts in Guaraní language They specifically focused on the accentuation characters (including the “Saltillo” or “Pusó”), and the alternative structures of the letters y, e, and Y, that distinguish their use as vowels or consonants.
      </p>
      <p class="u-ff-manuale u-push-btm-none u-ti-double">
        As they defined the typographic color of the regular style, the two designers tested lean stroke weights and developed a Light style that—even though discarded at the time—could be revised, adjusted, and eventually published in the future. 
      </p>
      <p class="u-ff-manuale u-push-btm-none u-ti-double">
        The italic y required some interesting design accommodations. Initially, it had a classic tail that made it look too slanted in text settings. After trying many options, Eduardo and Pablo settled on the current letterform, which balances the rhythm of lowercase descenders through the inclusion of six different varieties: three soft descenders and three tough ones.

        Manuale was envisioned for online editorial projects (books, magazines, newspapers, blogs), but it also performs well in print. Eduardo and Pablo designed the letters for newspapers and magazine spreads, set on narrow columns with solid leading, as well as elegant headlines on flyers and brochures.

      <p class="u-ff-manuale u-push-btm-none u-ti-double">
        Headlines composed in the many styles of Saira would make a  suitable match for texts set in Manuale. Both families have sharp forms and slightly rectangular structures. For the best results in extended text settings, Eduardo and Pablo suggest reducing the size of Saira in order to optically adjust its x-height (510) to Manuale’s (491).

      <p class="u-ff-manuale u-push-btm-none">
        Manuale was inspired by the first book ever printed in the territory that would become Argentina. It is a contemporary interpretation of the typeface used in the production of the Manuale ad usum Patrum Societatis Iesu, an eighteenth-century book set in type designed by the Jesuit priest Paulo Restivo. The original was printed in a small format, just 3.6 by 5.2 inches, and composed in both Latin and Guaraní using gorda type, a historical Spanish measure equivalent to 14pt.
