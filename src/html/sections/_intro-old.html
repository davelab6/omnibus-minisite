        Welcome to a showcase of the Omnibus-Type <em>Press Series</em>. A new collection of typefaces that are made specifically for text-intensive typography such as in books, magazines and newspapers in both screen and print media. Each family can compose striking headlines or long text panels that invite immersive reading, and those typeface requirements have been prized by the publishing industry since its inception.

Each is present with a set of 8 styles: Four weights from Regular to Bold plus italics. Each provides optimal legibility and a harmonious appearance that is comfortable for immersive reading in extended text settings.

        Conceived at the intersection of different ideas, cultures and continents, the members of the Omnibus-Type collective are all connected by the same typographic passion. For these designers, typefaces are born, grow and develop as living beings with pulsing thoughts, knowledge and emotions.

        Whether they are to be displayed on screen or printed on paper, if they are created by old-school artists or digital natives, the Omnibus-Types works combines insights from academic research with common sense from walking the streets. Some projects are born free, to be used and seen by millions all over the world, while other projects begin when clients approach Omnibus-Type to specifically create their exclusive brand fonts and create unique letterforms of their identity.

        All of them are continuously maturing and evolving. A true combination of aesthetic acumen and technical precision requires continual adaptation to new uses, new languages, and new technologies.
