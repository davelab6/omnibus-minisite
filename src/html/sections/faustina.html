          Following Robert Bringhurst’s classification scheme, Faustina could be considered a postmodern typeface. Its main features emerge as a dialogue between straight and curved shapes, conveying the necessary rigor for editorial use without compromising elegance. This trait is best appreciated at sizes above 48pt.

          All of García’s decisions were aimed at optimizing spatial efficiency. Faustina was designed for newspapers, where narrow columns and small leading between lines provide tight spaces to fit a great deal of content. Faustina’s strong, straight serifs combine with rounded terminals on letters like the lowercase ‘a’ and ‘c’. Its proportions are slightly condensed, the ‘o’ being closer to an ellipse than a circle, while the strong x-height and open counters were designed to work in small sizes, with low-quality paper and low-resolution screens in mind.

        <p class="u-ff-faustina u-push-btm-none">
          Faustina was designed in two phases, beginning during García’s postgraduate work at the University of Buenos Aires and continuing through a later period of refinement over several years after his graduation. For García, the design process involved a great deal of thinking and reworking details over time, redrawing features and adjusting the spacing to create greater consistency and coherence. 
        </p>
        <p class="u-ff-faustina u-push-btm-none u-ti-double">
          The first design stage included a basic Regular set plus a few characters of other styles. Once this was finished, he continued by expanding the original Regular and completing it with Bold and Italics for both styles. By the end of 2014, García presented the full Faustina family as a set of four styles with 330 characters each.

          Later, when development of Faustina continued at Omnibus-Type, the original family doubled its number of characters and added two more weight variations. As a result, Faustina became a complete suite of eight styles (Regular, Medium, Semibold and Bold, plus Italics) suitable for use in all languages written in the Latin alphabet.

          Faustina was designed for editorial use, specifically for printed newspapers, but it also  performs well in editorial uses or on digital displays. García found that Faustina worked especially well in combination with Ruda. They both have large x-heights and a similar balance in their shapes and counters.

          Faustina was the final project of Alfonso García for his Master’s Degree in Type Design at the University of Buenos Aires. The idea initially emerged from a text by type designer Victor Gaultney that presented the challenge of creating a space-efficient typeface for editorial use. The typeface had to maintain the classic characteristics of newspaper type while maintaining legibility at small sizes.
